## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is a VCS that allows you to keep track of all changes in a project and stores everything in the cloud.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
GitHub is the command line you can use to pull a project onto your computer and can edit the project.
3. Why do we create a branch?
You create a branch so you can make changes to a project without it affecting the whole project until it gets merged back.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
It lets you share your work with other people on your project and can be double checked by a senior developer before it gets merged back to the main branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
 git checkout main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
' git fetch' lets you retrieve new work done by other people without merging into their own branch 
'git merge' this merges the lines of code from multiple branches back to the main branch and changes the project for everyone. 
'git pull' updates local code on a developers computer to its remote counterpart.
7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when competing changes are made on the same line of a file.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Using Git you cd to the Git repository with the conflict and generate a list. You then decide which of the opposing lines you want to keep and use and make a new commit.
